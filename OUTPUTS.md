### Files

These tables are used to store information about the files that were scraped.

    - `filename`: The name of the file (`TEXT`)

## Files

All files scraped will be stored in the `target/files` directory in the same directory as the `config.json` file. The directory structure will simply follow the URL with the `https://` header removed. For example, if the site is `https://www.example.com/somdir/file.png`, the files will be stored in the `target/files/www.example.com/somdir/file.png` directory.

Files that are stored in Enjin's Amazon S3 instance for your site will be automatically downloaded and stored in the `target/files` directory. The files will be stored in the same directory structure as they are on the S3 instance.  All information about these files will be stored in the `s3_files` table in the database. Examples of modules that store files here include galleries, forums, applications, tickets, and news posts.

Files from wiki pages will generally be found under `target/files/s3.amazonaws.com/files.enjin.com/${siteID}/modules/wiki/${wikiPresetID}/file.png`.

User avatars are also scraped, which combines the URLs found in `user_profiles.avatar`, `user_wall_comments.avatar`, and `user_wall_post_likes.avatar`. These will generally be found under `assets-cloud.enjin.com/users/${userID}/avatar/full.${fileID}.png`. Note that these files are generally stored in the database with the size medium, but we download the full size only instead.

Profile cover images come from `user_profiles.cover_image` and are found in either `https://assets-cloud.enjin.com/users/${userID}/cover/${fileID}.png` if the user has uploaded their own cover image, or `resources.enjin.com/${resourceLocator}/themes/${version}/image/profile/cover/${category}/${fileName}.jpg` if the user is using an Enjin provided cover image.

Game boxes are the images displayed for games a user has on their profile. They are found in `assets-cloud.enjin.com/gameboxes/${gameID}/boxmedium.jpg`.

Lastly, user album images from `user_images.url_original` can be found in either `s3.amazonaws.com/assets.enjin.com/users/${userID}/pics/original/${fileName}` or `assets.enjin.com/wall_embed_images/${fileName}`.
